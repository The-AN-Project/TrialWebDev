This is the framework of every website we'll do, everything will be based off this repo.

I want every website to have the following:
  - Homepage
  - About
  - Services
  - Contact / Hours

To do so, create HTML files for the backbone of the website, style and customize using CSS and JavaScript.

Finally, find a host server and a domain to finalize and put on the internet.

Good luck.
